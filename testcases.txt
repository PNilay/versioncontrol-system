Test Cases:
Server command:
./WTFServer <port>
--> This command opens up a connection where all the client can  make connection and join and work on project.

Client Commands:
•  ./WTF configure <IP> <Port>
->This Commands takes two inputs, IP  address of server and Port at which server is listening to.
->This commands save this IP and Port into  .Configure file for future uses.
->This .Configure file stays in directory until user runs make clean command.   

• ./WTF checkout <project name>
->This commands take project name  as input and check if this project exists on Client side of the Repository, and if it does than 
  it will print a message "Project already exists on client side".
-> If the project does not exists on  Client side then this project will connect to server and fetch this whole project 
  from server throrugh socket and creates a project folder and recreate files that Server had in it's project directory. 
  At sucessful completion Client prints out sucess message "checkout command Successful!".
 	
•./WTF create <Projectname>
-> This command takes a project name and create this project to server side with manifest file initalized to version 0 and then  
  server send it to clieint and client create same prject in it's own directory.
--> This command only works if Server doesn't contain this project before calling create.

•./WTF destroy <Projectname>
-> This command takes a project name and destroy this project from server side by removing all files and manifest file from
   it's directory.
--> This command only works if Server contain this project before calling destroy.

•./WTF add <Projectname> <filename>
-->This command add file to project folder on client side.
--> This command will only work if projectname folder exists, and also filename  file exists in that folder.
--> This functions add filename file to Client's manifest.

•./WTF remove <Projectname> <filename>
--> This function removes filename from manifest file in Client side of the project if exists.
--> on sucessful completion of remove it prints out "[C]: Project Removed!".

•./WTF currentversion  <Projectname>
-->This commands prints out all the file and it's version number on command line for this projectname, which is on server side.
--> this command prints current version  and file path for server side project folders.
